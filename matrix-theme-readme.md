# Hacker's Den Matrix Theme

This document explains how the Matrix-themed RSS feed site is implemented and maintained.

## Overview

The Matrix theme for Hacker's Den is implemented as a series of customizations applied on top of the standard RSS feed site generated by the RSSPAPER JAR file. Since we're not modifying the RSSPAPER source code directly, we use a post-processing approach to apply our Matrix theme after the site is generated.

## How It Works

1. **update_feed.sh Script**: This is the main script that handles running the JAR and applying the Matrix theme customizations.

2. **Theme Backup**: Your custom theme files are stored in the `matrix-theme-backup` directory to ensure they persist between JAR runs.

3. **Customization Process**:
   - Run the RSSPAPER JAR to generate a fresh RSS feed site
   - Apply Matrix theme CSS and JavaScript customizations
   - Inject Matrix animations and terminal-style elements
   - Update color schemes to match the Matrix aesthetic

## Files and Directories

- **update_feed.sh**: Main script for running the JAR and applying Matrix theme
- **matrix-theme-backup/**: Directory containing your custom theme files
  - **css/custom-matrix.css**: Additional Matrix style customizations
  - **matrix.css**: Main Matrix theme styles
  - **index.html**: Backup of your custom HTML template
  - **manifest.json**: PWA configuration with Matrix theme colors

## How to Update Your RSS Feed

To update your RSS feed with fresh content while maintaining the Matrix theme:

```bash
# Just run the update script
./update_feed.sh
```

This will:
1. Run the RSSPAPER JAR to fetch fresh content from your RSS feeds
2. Apply all your Matrix theme customizations
3. Output the resulting site to the `dist` directory

## Customizing the Theme Further

If you want to make additional customizations to your Matrix theme:

1. Edit `/workspaces/Hackers-Den/matrix-theme-backup/css/custom-matrix.css` to add new CSS styles
2. Run `./update_feed.sh` to apply your changes

Your customizations will be preserved between updates.

## Adding New RSS Feeds

To add new RSS feeds to your Hacker's Den:

1. Edit the `config.yaml` file to add or remove RSS feed URLs
2. Run `./update_feed.sh` to regenerate the site with the updated feeds

## Matrix Theme Elements

The Matrix theme includes:

- Falling Matrix characters animation in the background
- Terminal-style article headers with command prompt styling
- Glowing green text with flicker and pulse animations
- Custom scrollbar with Matrix green coloring
- Image filters giving them a green tint
- "[INBOUND-SIGNAL]" indicators for articles
- Blinking cursor effect on the main title
