# Static-RSS
My custom Static RSS feed updated daily with Github Actions

# Thanks To:
```
https://github.com/tanrax/RSSPAPER (Update JAR as needed in this directory)
https://github.com/actions/upload-pages-artifact (Using version v3)
```

# TODO:
update favicon.ico + maybe dp cloudpages + add certain rss feeds to their own category to declutter homepage?
Note: Updated actions/upload-pages-artifact to version v3 to resolve package version not found error.
